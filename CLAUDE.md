## Project Analysis

1. **quasar-club-system**: Advanced implementation using Quasar framework

The project is football team management system with features for:
- User authentication (login/register)
- Team management
- Survey system with voting
- Dashboard functionality
- Multi-language support (Czech/English)

## Technologies Used
### club-system (Basic version):
- Vue.js 3.4.29
- Vite (build tool)
- Pinia (state management)
- Vue Router
- Firebase 11.0.1
- Bootstrap 5.3.3
- Vue i18n (internationalization)

### quasar-club-system (Advanced version):
- Vue.js 3.4.18
- Quasar Framework 2.16.0
- Vite (via Quasar CLI)
- Pinia (state management)
- Vue Router
- Firebase 11.4.0
- Axios (HTTP client)
- Luxon (date handling)
- Vue i18n
- TypeScript support

## How to Run
### quasar-club-system
```bash
cd quasar-club-system
yarn install
quasar dev
```

Build for production:
```bash
quasar build
```

Linting:
```bash
npm run lint
```

## Data Architecture (Clean Architecture)

### **Layer Structure:**
1. **Components** → UI-focused Vue components
2. **UI Composables** → Component-specific logic delegation 
3. **Use Cases** → Business logic orchestration
4. **Firebase Services** → Pure Firebase operations
5. **Pinia Stores** → Pure state management (no business logic)

### **Key Files:**
- **Stores**: `authStore.ts`, `teamStore.ts` (Setup Store pattern, state only)
- **Services**: `authFirebase.ts`, `teamFirebase.ts`, `surveyFirebase.ts` (Firebase operations)
- **Use Cases**: `useAuthUseCases.ts`, `useTeamUseCases.ts`, `useSurveyUseCases.ts` (business logic)
- **UI Composables**: `useAuthComposable.ts`, `useTeamComposable.ts` (UI delegation)

### **Flow:**
Components → UI Composables → Use Cases → Firebase Services → Stores (state updates)

### **Authentication Timing:**
- Auth listener setup with timing buffers (100-300ms delays)
- Team/notification listeners wait for auth completion
- Error handling for permission-denied scenarios

## Available Tools & Services
### Context7 MCP Server
- Available for documentation reading and library lookup
- Use `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id` to find library IDs
- Use `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` to fetch documentation
- Supports popular libraries and frameworks
- Always resolve library ID first before fetching docs unless user provides explicit ID format '/org/project' or '/org/project/version'
