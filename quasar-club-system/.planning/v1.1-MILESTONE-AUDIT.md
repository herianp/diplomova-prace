# Milestone v1.1 Audit: New User Onboarding & No-Team UX

**Audited:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** gaps_found
**Score:** 8/17 requirements satisfied

## Milestone Goal

New users see a guided onboarding wizard and all pages handle the "no team" state gracefully.

---

## Phase Summary

| Phase | Name | Plans | Status | Requirements |
|-------|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| 10 | Onboarding Wizard & Route Guarding | 2/2 | ✓ Complete | ONB-01-04, ROUTE-01-02 |
| 11 | Team Creation | 1/1 | ✓ Complete | TEAM-01-02 |
| 12 | Team Discovery & Join Requests | 0/4 | ✗ Not started | DISC-01-05 |
| 13 | Empty States | 0/2 | ✗ Not started | EMPTY-01-04 |

**Phases complete:** 2/4

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

| REQ-ID | Description | Phase | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY Frontmatter | Traceability | Final Status |
|--------|-------------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------|-------------|
| ONB-01 | User without team sees onboarding wizard | 10 | SATISFIED | 10-01 | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| ONB-02 | User can set display name during onboarding | 10 | SATISFIED | 10-02 | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| ONB-03 | User can choose between creating/browsing teams | 10 | SATISFIED | 10-02 | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| ONB-04 | User who completes onboarding lands on dashboard | 10 | SATISFIED | 10-02 | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| ROUTE-01 | Teamless users redirected to onboarding | 10 | SATISFIED | 10-01 | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| ROUTE-02 | Users with team skip onboarding | 10 | SATISFIED | 10-01 | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| TEAM-01 | Any user can create a team | 11 | SATISFIED | 11-01 | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| TEAM-02 | Team creator becomes power user | 11 | SATISFIED | 11-01 | `[x]` Complete | **satisfied** |
| DISC-01 | Browse teams list | 12 | missing | missing | `[ ]` Pending | **unsatisfied** |
| DISC-02 | Send join request | 12 | missing | missing | `[ ]` Pending | **unsatisfied** |
| DISC-03 | Power user sees pending requests | 12 | missing | missing | `[ ]` Pending | **unsatisfied** |
| DISC-04 | Approve/decline requests | 12 | missing | missing | `[ ]` Pending | **unsatisfied** |
| DISC-05 | Approved user added to team | 12 | missing | missing | `[ ]` Pending | **unsatisfied** |
| EMPTY-01 | Dashboard empty state | 13 | missing | missing | `[ ]` Pending | **unsatisfied** |
| EMPTY-02 | Surveys empty state | 13 | missing | missing | `[ ]` Pending | **unsatisfied** |
| EMPTY-03 | Reports empty state | 13 | missing | missing | `[ ]` Pending | **unsatisfied** |
| EMPTY-04 | Players empty state | 13 | missing | missing | `[ ]` Pending | **unsatisfied** |

**Requirements satisfied:** 8/17
**Orphaned requirements:** 0

---

## Cross-Phase Integration

**Score:** 14/14 connections verified
**Broken E2E flows:** 0/3
**Orphaned exports:** 1 (non-blocking i18n dead key)

### E2E Flows Verified

| Flow | Status |
|------|--------|
| New user register → route guard → onboarding wizard | ✓ Complete |
| Display name save → Firebase Auth + Firestore | ✓ Complete |
| Team creation → Firestore → listener → success screen → dashboard | ✓ Complete |

### Integration Readiness for Remaining Phases

- **Phase 12:** `teamChoicePath === 'browse'` slot in both wizard variants is ready for team browse UI; `teamStore.teams` watcher auto-triggers success screen when user joins a team
- **Phase 13:** Route guard already intercepts teamless users; empty states need component-level `teamStore.teams.length === 0` checks on each page

---

## Tech Debt

### Phase 10: Onboarding Wizard & Route Guarding
- 2 human verification items pending (route guard live redirect, step 3 back navigation)

### Phase 11: Team Creation
- 3 human verification items pending (E2E team creation flow, validation feedback, loading state)
- Orphaned i18n key: `onboarding.teamChoice.createPlaceholder` in both locale files (dead string from Phase 10 placeholder, replaced by CreateTeamForm in Phase 11)

### Total: 6 items across 2 phases

---

## Gaps Analysis

All 9 unsatisfied requirements belong to **unstarted phases** (12 and 13). No requirement has been orphaned or dropped — they are correctly mapped in REQUIREMENTS.md traceability and have defined plans in the ROADMAP.

- **Phase 12** (DISC-01 through DISC-05): 4 plans defined in roadmap, 0 executed
- **Phase 13** (EMPTY-01 through EMPTY-04): 2 plans defined in roadmap, 0 executed
