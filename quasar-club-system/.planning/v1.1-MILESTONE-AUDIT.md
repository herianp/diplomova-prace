# Milestone v1.1 Audit: New User Onboarding & No-Team UX

**Audited:** 2026-02-22
**Status:** gaps_found
**Milestone Goal:** New users see a guided onboarding wizard and all pages handle the "no team" state gracefully.

---

## Phase Completion

| Phase | Name | Status | Verification |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| 10 | Onboarding Wizard & Route Guarding | ✓ Complete | ✓ 9/9 truths verified |

| 12 | Team Discovery & Join Requests | ✗ Not started | No VERIFICATION.md |
| 13 | Empty States | ✗ Not started | No VERIFICATION.md |

**Phases complete:** 1/4

## Integration Check

**Score:** 9/9 Phase 10 exports properly wired
**Orphaned exports:** 0
**Broken E2E flows:** 0
**E2E flows verified:** 4/4

| Flow | Status |
|------|--------|
| New user register → onboarding wizard | ✓ Complete |
| Existing user with team → dashboard | ✓ Complete |
| Logout from onboarding → login | ✓ Complete |
| Direct URL to protected page (teamless) → onboarding | ✓ Complete |

**Integration readiness for remaining phases:**
- Phase 11: `teamChoicePath === 'create'` slot is ready; `teamFirebase.createTeam` already sets `powerusers: [userId]`
- Phase 12: `teamChoicePath === 'browse'` slot is ready; `teamStore.teams` watcher auto-triggers success screen
- Phase 13: Route guard already intercepts teamless users; empty states just need component-level checks

**Note:** One cosmetic double-navigation on logout (OnboardingLayout pushes `/login`, then auth listener pushes `/`). Both resolve to `/login`. Same pattern exists throughout the codebase — not a Phase 10 regression.

## Tech Debt

None accumulated in Phase 10. No TODOs, stubs, or deferred items found.
