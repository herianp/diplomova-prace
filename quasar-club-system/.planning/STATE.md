# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-14)

**Core value:** Reliable real-time survey voting and team management that works correctly under concurrent use — no lost votes, no stale data, no silent failures.
**Current focus:** Phase 3 - Code Quality and TypeScript

## Current Position

Phase: 3 of 9 (Code Quality and TypeScript)
Plan: 2 of 4 in current phase
Status: In Progress
Last activity: 2026-02-15 — Completed 03-01-PLAN.md (TypeScript Strict Mode) and 03-02-PLAN.md (i18n TypeScript Conversion)

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 28% (2/9 phases complete, 2/4 plans in current phase)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 10
- Average duration: 13.2 minutes
- Total execution time: 2.3 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-error-system-foundation | 5 | 102.4 min | 20.5 min |
| 02-listener-registry-system | 3 | 9.6 min | 3.2 min |
| 03-code-quality-typescript | 2 | 15.0 min | 7.5 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 02-01 (3.3min), 02-02 (4.8min), 02-03 (1.5min), 03-02 (6min), 03-01 (9min)
- Trend: Phase 03 in progress - TypeScript strict mode required more fixes than estimated (avg 7.5min/plan)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase structure: 9 phases derived from requirement clustering (ERR → LST → QAL → DAT → SEC → PRF → TST split 3-way)
- Testing split: Separated infrastructure (Phase 7), implementation (Phase 8), CI/CD (Phase 9) for comprehensive depth
- Migration safety: Phase 4 depends on Phase 3 to ensure testing infrastructure exists before risky data migration
- Brownfield approach: All phases address existing codebase hardening, not greenfield development
- Error class prototype chain fix: Applied Object.setPrototypeOf only in AppError base class for instanceof compatibility (01-01)
- Error message organization: Separated error messages into dedicated errors.js files instead of inline in index.js (01-01)
- [Phase 01]: Retry only available with explicit onRetry callback (not in global handler)
- [Phase 01-error-system-foundation]: Retry only for transient errors (network, unavailable, deadline-exceeded) - no retry for destructive operations or permanent errors
- [Phase 01-05]: Network errors show retry button, permanent errors (wrong password, weak password) don't
- [Phase 01-05]: No-user check moved outside try-catch for clearer error path in changeUserPassword
- [Phase 02-01]: Promise-based auth coordination eliminates timing buffers and race conditions
- [Phase 02-01]: ListenerRegistry manages all listener lifecycle instead of individual stores
- [Phase 02-01]: Scope-based cleanup enables team-switch cleanup (team vs user scoped listeners)
- [Phase 02-02]: Auto-cleanup on re-register eliminates manual unsubscribe checks
- [Phase 02-02]: All 9 listener types registered with central registry (zero local unsubscribe storage)
- [Phase 02-02]: Team switching cleanup via unregisterByScope('team') prevents stale data leaks
- [Phase 02-03]: App.vue safety net cleanup on unmount provides final guarantee
- [Phase 02-03]: Developer debug interface (__listenerDebug) available in dev mode for memory leak inspection
- [Phase 03-01]: Enabled full TypeScript strict mode immediately instead of incremental (15 explicit any + 30+ implicit errors manageable)
- [Phase 03-01]: Used type guards in validation rules for unknown → typed narrowing
- [Phase 03-01]: Controlled 'as any' usage only for Chart.js and i18n complex types
- [Phase 03-02]: Keep legacy: true mode for template $t() compatibility (i18n)
- [Phase 03-02]: Use Czech locale as primary for MessageSchema type inference
- [Phase 03-02]: Export MessageSchema type for composition API use cases
- [Phase 03-02]: Add localStorage persistence for language preference in boot file

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Known risks from research:**
- Phase 4 migration complexity: Firestore dual-write pattern needs validation during planning (research flag noted)
- Phase 5 Sentry integration: Quasar-specific setup may differ from standard Vue 3 (verify during planning)
- Windows emulator compatibility: Firebase emulator suite on MINGW64_NT needs verification (Phase 7)
- TypeScript strict mode impact: May reveal extensive type errors requiring incremental fixes (Phase 3)
