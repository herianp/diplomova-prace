# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-14)

**Core value:** Reliable real-time survey voting and team management that works correctly under concurrent use — no lost votes, no stale data, no silent failures.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Error System Foundation

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase structure: 9 phases derived from requirement clustering (ERR → LST → QAL → DAT → SEC → PRF → TST split 3-way)
- Testing split: Separated infrastructure (Phase 7), implementation (Phase 8), CI/CD (Phase 9) for comprehensive depth
- Migration safety: Phase 4 depends on Phase 3 to ensure testing infrastructure exists before risky data migration
- Brownfield approach: All phases address existing codebase hardening, not greenfield development

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Known risks from research:**
- Phase 4 migration complexity: Firestore dual-write pattern needs validation during planning (research flag noted)
- Phase 5 Sentry integration: Quasar-specific setup may differ from standard Vue 3 (verify during planning)
- Windows emulator compatibility: Firebase emulator suite on MINGW64_NT needs verification (Phase 7)
- TypeScript strict mode impact: May reveal extensive type errors requiring incremental fixes (Phase 3)
